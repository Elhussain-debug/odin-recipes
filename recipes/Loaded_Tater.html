    <ol>
      <li>
        Gather ingredients. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
        Spray 12 cups of a standard muffin pan with nonstick cooking spray.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place 5 tater tots in each of the 12 slots. Bake tots in the preheated
        oven for 10 minutes. Remove the muffin pan from the oven.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use a tamper or the bottom of a small glass to press the tater tots down
        into the bottom and sides of each cup. This will create a tater tot cup.
        Place back in the oven and cook 10 minutes more.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir
        ground beef with taco seasoning in the hot skillet until browned and
        crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and discard grease
      </li>
      <li>Divide ground beef between the cups. Top with shredded cheese</li>
      <li>
        Return the muffin pan to the oven and bake until cheese is melted, about
        5 minutes. Remove from the oven to a rack to cool for 3 minutes. Top
        with lettuce, salsa, and sour cream.

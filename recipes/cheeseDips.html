    <ul>
      <li>
        Meat: This satisfying cheese dip starts with ground beef and ground pork
        sausage.
      </li>
      <li>Onion: Cook the meat with a diced onion.</li>
      <li>
        Cheese: You'll need a loaf of processed cheese food, such as Velveeta.
      </li>
      <li>
        Tomatoes: A can of diced tomatoes and green chile peppers lends flavor
        and color.
      </li>
      <li>
        Soup: A can of condensed cream of mushroom soup ensures a thick, creamy
        dip.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Crumble sausage and ground
        beef into the skillet; add onion. Cook and stir until the meat is evenly
        browned, and no longer pink, about 10 minutes; drain and discard any
        excess grease. Transfer meat mixture into a slow cooker.
      </li>
      <li>Layer cheese food cubes atop meat mixture.</li>
      <li>
        Blend diced tomatoes with green chile peppers in a blender until smooth;
        pour over cheese cubes along with condensed soup. Stir well and cover.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook on High, stirring occasionally until the cheese is completely
        melted, about 90 minutes.
      </li>
    </ol>

    </p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>cooking spray</li>
      <li>1 pound 80% lean ground beef</li>
      <li>3 slices bacon, chopped</li>
      <li>¼ cup minced onion</li>
      <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons dill pickle relish</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons yellow mustard</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons BBQ sauce</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
      <li>
        1 (16.3 ounce) package refrigerated biscuit dough (such as Pillsbury
        Grands!®)
      </li>
      <li>5 ounces Cheddar cheese</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons sesame seeds</li>
      <li>⅓ cup ketchup</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Coat 16 cups of 2
        muffin pans with cooking spray.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add ground beef, bacon, onion,
        salt, and pepper and cook, stirring, until beef is browned, about 6
        minutes. Drain fat, and stir in dill pickle relish, mustard, BBQ sauce,
        and garlic powder. Set filling aside to cool.
      </li>
      <li>
        Separate each biscuit dough portion in half to get 16 biscuits,
        stretching and pulling each into a circle about 1/4 inch thick. Spoon
        about 2 tablespoons of the ground beef mixture into the center of each
        dough circle. Cut cheese into 16 cubes and insert each cube into the
        ground beef mixture. Wrap dough around the filling in the shape of a
        ball and pinch edges on the bottom together so biscuits are sealed
        around the filling.
      </li>
      <li>
        Set each biscuit seam side down in a muffin cup. Lightly spray the
        biscuit tops with cooking spray and sprinkle with sesame seeds.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Serve
        with ketchup for dipping on the side.
